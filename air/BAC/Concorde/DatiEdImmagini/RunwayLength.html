6.1.2 Maintenance</b>
<br><br>

 
The aircraft had undergone a scheduled check AO1 in accordance with the approved maintenance programme. The check commenced on 17 July 2000 and was completed
on the 21st. During the check, the left main landing gear bogie had been replaced in order to correct an acceptable deferred defect related to the under-inflation detection
system. 
 <br>
Since the A check, the aircraft had undertaken four flights, on July 21, 22, 23 and 24. On the 24th, several maintenance operations had been carried out:

<p>
The aircraft was originally planned as a reserve for 25 July. F-BVFA was planned to carry out scheduled flight 002 in the morning and F-BVFC to undertake Flight 4590. For
maintenance reasons, there was an allocation change between F BVFA and F-BVFC. F-BVFA was finally declared unavailable during the night and the reserve aircraft,
F-BTSC, was programmed in its place to carry out Flight 4590.
 <p>
The aircraft was airworthy and there were no acceptable deferred defects for Flight 4590. Prior to the flight, the GARRETT pneumatic motor which activates the engine n° 2
secondary exhaust nozzle buckets, had been replaced. Tests had been carried out and they revealed no anomalies. 
 <p>

<h3>6.2 Landing Gear</h3>
<p>

<b>6.2.1 General</b>

 <p>
The Concorde has a nose gear, an auxiliary gear situated at the rear of the fuselage and two main landing gears, each with a bogie with four wheels. The bogies are
equipped with a system which detects under-inflation of a tyre and transmits a visual signal to the cockpit. This detection system is inhibited when the speed of the front
wheels is less than 10 kt or when the indicated airspeed is above 135 kt.
<p>


<b>6.2.2 Gear Retraction </b>
<p>
 
Gear retraction is controlled electrically by the landing gear control lever situated on the pilot¹s panel (three-position lever: up, neutral, down) and is activated by hydraulic
pressure from the Green circuit (see figure 1). The lever cannot be moved from the "neutral" position to the "up" position unless the left main landing gear shock strut is no
longer compressed.
 <p>
Conditions for gear retraction:<br>
<ul>
-          The gear doors must be unlocked and open.<br>
-          The main and nose gears must no longer be compressed.<br>
-          The front wheels must be centred<br>
-          The main landing gear bogies must be perpendicular to the gear leg.<br>

</ul>
 <p>
<table>
<td valign=top>

   
When all of the landing gear is
locked in the "up" position, the
gear doors close. During
retraction of the main gear, the
shock struts are retracted into
the gear leg to allow them to fit
in the gear well. The wheels
are automatically braked when
the gear selector is in the "up"
position.
 <p>
For the landing gear, the
Yellow hydraulic circuit is used
only if there is a failure in the
Green circuit. The
perpendicularity of the gear is
ensured by two autonomous
nitrogen-powered pneumatic
actuators

<b>6.2.3 Braking</b>
<p>
<table>
<td valign=top>

 The brakes are manufactured by
 Dunlop. Braking is electrically
 controlled and is activated by hydraulic
 pressure from the Green circuit in
 normal conditions.
  <p>
 In case of failure in the Green circuit,
 an automatic switch allows the Yellow
 circuit to be used. In case of
 emergency braking, only the Yellow
 circuit is used in direct hydraulic liaison
 with the rudder bars.

<br>

<b>6.2.4 Deflectors</b>
<p>
<table>

<td valign=top>
 
 The deflectors are made of composite materials
 and fibreglass (to make them frangible) except for
 the bogie fasteners. Each deflector weighs
 around 4 kg and is located at the front of each
 main landing gear. Their function is to deflect
 water and spray to ensure it does not enter the
 engine air intakes. These deflectors were the
 subject of an optional Service Bulletin (SST
 32-103 of 12/01/95 modified on 28/02/95) which
 proposed the insertion of two cables in the
 leading edge in order to retain pieces of the
 deflectors in case of failure. Air France did not
 apply the aforementioned Service Bulletin.

<b>6.2.5 Wheels and Tyres</b>
<p>

 
The wheels were manufactured by Dunlop, and the tyres used by Air France were manufactured by Goodyear in the United States. No retread tyres have been used since
1997.
<p> 
On the day of the accident, the main landing gear wheels and tyres on F-BTSC were installed as follows:

<h3>6.3 Fuel </h3>
<p>
 
The signal from each fuel gauge is sent simultaneously to the corresponding indicator and to a totaliser. By design, error in measurement of the total fuel quantity must not
exceed 5 % in extreme flight conditions, and the error in measurement on each of the tanks must not exceed 2 %. The quantity of fuel present in a tank can be considered
to be correctly indicated when the reading is greater than zero. The quantity present cannot be presumed if the above does not apply.
 <p>
Note: a general electrical power cut fixes the last indication supplied by the needles and masks the indications on the rollers with a flag. The failure of an electrical
connection from a fuel gauge leads to an indication of zero on the corresponding indicator.
 <p>
Before the accident flight, the tanks had been filled with jet fuel (Jet A1). An overfill of 300 litres, equivalent to a quantity of 237 kg had been added. In total, the quantity
loaded was around 94 800 kg.
 <p>
Note: the overfill procedure allowed loading of a maximum of 1 630 litres extra, compared to the quantities mentioned below.
 <p>
The capacity of the thirteen tanks is presented in the table below. These represent maximum capacities without exceeding the level of the upper sensors.<p>

<b>6.4.2 Contingency Mode</b>
<p>

 
The contingency mode can be activated manually or automatically in the case of engine failure on takeoff. Thrust above the maximum takeoff thrust can then be provided by
remaining engines. Automatic mode is activated when:<p>
<ul>
 
-          The throttle levers move above the 10 % level,<br>
-          Reheat is activated on any engine,<br>
-          The take off monitor is armed,<br>
-          N2 on an engine goes below 58.6 %.<br>
</ul>
 <p>
The power of the other three engines then increases automatically up to a level which may reach 105 % of N2.<p>
<br>
<br>
 

<b>6.4.3 Reheat Cutout</b>
<br>
 <br>
As soon as an engine¹s N1 falls below 75 %, reheat on that engine is disconnected. Reheat is re-activated when N1 exceeds 81 %.
 <br>
<br>
<b>6.4.4 Fire Protection</b>

 <br><br>
Fire detection on an engine is ensured by two loops which react to increases in temperature. They are made up of four components assembled in line so as to detect:<br><ul>
 
-          A fire around the engine and/or <br>
-          A torch flame fire around the combustion chamber.<br>
 <br></ul>
If only one loop detects a fire, the loop is indicated as faulty and has to be shut off by the crew. If both loops detect a fire, the Gong sounds and the appropriate red
ENGINE warning light comes on in the Main Warning System (MWS) panel, followed by a flashing red warning light on the engine shutdown/fire handle of the corresponding
engine and an aural warning (bell).<br>
 <br>
Pulling the engine shutdown/fire handle shuts:<br><br>
 <ul>
-          The air conditioning valve<br>
-          The hydraulic shutoff valve<br>
-          The LP and HP fuel supply valves<br>
-          The reheat fuel supply valve<br>
-          The fire doors.<br>
 <br></ul>
The dual head extinguishers are activated by two push buttons located behind each engine shutdown/fire handle.<br>
 <br>
Note: the red warning light in the Main Warning System is also associated with alarms for low oil pressure, engine TCA overheat, and detection of liquid in the dry bays.<br>
 <br>
<br>
<b>6.4.5 Engine Maintenance<br></b>
<br>
 <br>
Each engine consists of twelve modules whose maintenance is undertaken by Air France, by SNECMA Services or by GEAS. The final assembly is performed by GEAS.<br>
Tasks performed can be of three types: visual inspection, partial repair or major repair based on the Olympus Maintenance Manual.<br>
 <br>
Readings taken by the FE during supersonic flight of parameters such as EGT and FF assist in assessment of engine condition. The readings from these engines on
previous flights have not revealed any malfunctions.      <br>

(1) Nineteen items of baggage loaded on board were not taken into account, only 103 items appearing on the load sheet. There were 122 items of baggage loaded on
   board, with an average estimated weight of 20.7 kg each, making a total of 2 525 kg.
 <p>
Note: these items of baggage had not been taken into account by the Gaétan system nor by the Baggage Reconciliation System (See paragraph 16.2).
 <p>
(2)   By applying the fixed average for passengers: one passenger = 84 kg, one child = 35 kg.
 <p>
(3)   By applying the fixed average for men and women: one man = 88 kg, one woman = 70 kg, one child = 35 kg.
 <p>
Note: for holiday charter flights, it is also possible to use a fixed average of 76 kg per passenger.
 <p>
(4)   Allowing that the aircraft consumed a ton of fuel during taxiing.
 <p>
(5)   The EIC corresponds to 60 kg of newspapers.

<br>
<b>6.5.2 Balance</b>

 <p>
The CG noted on the final load sheet gives a figure of 52.3 % at Zero Fuel Weight and 54.2 % for taxiing with fuel; this is the normal CG for a takeoff at maximum takeoff
weight. 
 <p>
<br>

<h3>6.6 Takeoff Performance</h3>
<p>
 <br>
The following parameters are used hereafter for performance calculations: <br>
 <ul> <br>
-          QNH of 1 008 hPa <br>
-          temperature 19 °C <br>
-          a dry runway  <br>
-          a CG of 54 %. <br>
  <br></ul>
The Operating Manual provides the maximum structural weights: <br>
  <br><ul>
-          for taxiing 186 880 kg  <br>
-          at takeoff 185 070 kg <br>
  <br></ul>
Since the wind readings at different test points show a light and variable wind, the calculations are made with calm wind conditions. <br>
  <p>
Note: the takeoff limitations evaluation gives a maximum performance weight of 186.7 tons. With this weight and the associated speeds (V1, V2, VR), the second segment
limitation and the tyre limitation have to be taken into account. The higher the aircraft speed on takeoff, the further the second segment limitation is pushed back. However,
this speed is further limited by the constraints imposed by the tyres.
  <p>
At the maximum structural weight at takeoff, the calculations provide the following values:
  <br><ul>
-          V1: between 139 and 162 kt (the crew selected 150 kt) <br>
-          VR: 199 kt <br>
-          V2: 220 kt (1.125 VZRC)  <br>
-          Three-engine trim: 12.9° <br>
 <p></ul>
The Flight Manual provides the following zero rate of climb (VZRC) figures.

Note: the notion of VZRC is important for Concorde. It is the cruising threshold speed, which allows the aircraft to remain in level flight at zero rate of climb. On a thrust/speed
diagram, VZRC is located at the intersection of the thrust available curve and the thrust required curve. These points represent an unstable condition. Furthermore, these
speed values are highly influenced by the actual weight of the aircraft.
<p>
Ground and air minimum control speeds:<br>
<br><ul>
 
      -VMCA = VMCG = 132 kt on three engines, <br>
      -VMCA = VMCG = 157 kt on two engines.<br>
 <br></ul>
Takeoff runway length required and takeoff distance required (Flight Manual):<br>
 <br><ul>
      -TORA = 3 370 metres<br>
      -TODA = 3 700 metres<br>
 <br></ul>
Note: These distances are regulated distances taking into account the failure of one engine.
 <p>
A calculated simulation can be performed based on these parameters and a serviceable aircraft with four engines operating. Since it is not possible to know the exact weight
at brake release (because of utilisation of the average passenger weights, for example), the maximum structural weight at takeoff (185.070 kg) is used for the calculations.
  <p>
 
The results of this simulation are as follows (rounded figures): <p>
 <ul>
-          V1 is reached 1 150 m, or 33 s, after brake release  <br>
-          VR is reached 2 070 m, or 43 s, after brake release <br>
-          V2 is reached 2 700 m, or 48 s, after brake release <br>
-          The wheels leave the ground 2 600 m after brake release <br>
-          The distance run to reach 35 feet is 2 950 metres  <br>
  <br></ul>
For all of these values, the influence of an increase in weight of one ton was examined and found to be negligible. <p>
